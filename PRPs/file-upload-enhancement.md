# PRP: Data Room File Upload Enhancement

## FEATURE
Add drag-and-drop file upload functionality to the data room with file categorization and progress indicators.

## EXAMPLES

### Existing Data Room Components
```jsx
// File: src/pages/dataRoom.tsx
- Current data room layout and structure
- Existing file categorization in src/components/dataRoom/
- Current file viewing patterns
```

### File Upload Component Pattern
```jsx
// Create new component following existing patterns
// Reference: src/components/ui/ for consistent styling
const FileUpload = ({ onUpload, acceptedTypes, maxSize }) => {
  const [isDragOver, setIsDragOver] = useState(false);
  const [uploadProgress, setUploadProgress] = useState(0);
  
  // Implementation following existing component patterns
};
```

### API Integration Pattern
```javascript
// File: src/service/api.ts
// Follow existing API call patterns for file operations
const uploadFile = async (file, category) => {
  try {
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('file', file);
    formData.append('category', category);
    
    const response = await api.post('/upload', formData, {
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data' },
      onUploadProgress: (progressEvent) => {
        // Progress tracking
      }
    });
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling following existing patterns
  }
};
```

## DOCUMENTATION
- File API documentation for drag-and-drop
- FormData API for file uploads
- Progress tracking with Axios
- File type validation best practices
- Tailwind CSS for upload UI components

## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### New Features
1. **Drag-and-Drop Zone**: Visual drop area with hover states
2. **File Type Validation**: Ensure only allowed file types
3. **Size Validation**: Prevent uploads that are too large
4. **Upload Progress**: Real-time progress indicators
5. **File Preview**: Show file details before upload
6. **Category Selection**: Auto-categorize or allow manual selection
7. **Batch Upload**: Support multiple file uploads

### Dependencies
- Use existing Axios setup for HTTP requests
- Leverage current UI components and styling
- Utilize existing file management patterns

### Performance
- Implement chunked uploads for large files
- Show progress indicators for user feedback
- Optimize file preview generation
- Handle upload cancellation
